% This file defines commands for "bending coordinate systems". This is
% needed, for instance, for bend arrow heads.
%
%
% By "bending coordinate system" I mean a curvilinear coordinate
% system in which the x-axis "goes along" a Bezier curve and the
% y-axis is always perpendicular to the (Bezier) curve at the given
% x-coordinate. Formally, given a pair (x,y), let B(x) be the point on
% the Bezier curve B at distance x from the start of the curve. Let
% T(x) be the tangent of B at B(x) and let P(x) be the (normalized)
% vector perpendicular to T(x). Then (x,y) would be mapped to B(x) +
% y*P(x). As an example, if B is a circle, then the corresponding
% bending coordinate system is (essentially, except for an offset in
% the y value) the polar coordinate system.
%
% Since it is next to impossible to quickly compute precise length
% of Bezier curves in TeX, instead of real distances along Bezier
% curves, we use the following trick: We compute precisely the "time" t_1
% (in the parametrization of the Bezier curve as a function of "time")
% needed to travel along one unit (1pt in TeX). We then act as if a
% length of, say, 20pt were then reached at time 20*t_1. In reality,
% this will not "really" be the correct point, but close enough for
% our purposes; especially when only small values of x near to the
% start/end of the curve are used.
%
% You use the bending cs by first telling pgf which Bezier curve you
% are interested in (using \pgfsetbendingline or \pgfsetbendingcurve)
% and then using \pgfpointbending. The results will be best if small
% values of x are used because of the abovementioned trick of
% substituing distance by time. 
%
% When a new bending cs is installed, some, possibly expensive,
% precomputations are done. Subsequent calls to \pgfpointbending
% should then be relatively quick.



% Returns a point in the current bending coordinate system.
