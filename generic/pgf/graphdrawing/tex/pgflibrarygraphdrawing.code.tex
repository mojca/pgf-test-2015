% Basic Interface to the Graph Drawing Engine
%

% 
% In order to use the graph drawing engine, inside a pgfpicture you
% need to create a graph drawing scope using the following commands;
%


%
% An if that is true exactly if we are inside a graph drawing scope
%

\newif\ifpgfgdgraphdrawingscopeactive


% Begins a new graph drawing scope
% 
% Description:
%
% Inside a graph drawing scope, all pgf nodes that are newly created
% are automatically passed to the graph drawing engine. In contrast,
% edges have to be indicated explicitly using the macro \pgfgdedge
% (this is because it is somewhat unclear what, exactly, should count
% as an edge). Naturally, users typically will not call \pgfgdedge
% explicitly, but have styles and keys invoke it internally.
%
% Usage:
% 
% \pgfgdset{algorithm=somealgorithm}
% \pgfgdbeginscope
%   \pgfnode{rectangle}{center}{A}{A}{}
%   \pgfnode{rectangle}{center}{B}{B}{}
%   \pgfnode{rectangle}{center}{C}{C}{}
%   \pgfgdedge{A}{B}{->}{}{}
%   \pgfgdedge{B}{C}{->}{}{}
%   \pgfgdedge{C}{A}{->}{}{}
% \pgfgdendscope
% 
% Naturally, users will typically use TikZ's somewhat simpler syntax: 
% 
% \tikz \graph [some algorithm] { A -> B -> C -> A };

% Passing options to the graph drawing engine.
% 
% #1 = option's name
% #2 = option's value
% 
% Description:
%
% When a graph drawing algorithm starts working, a set of options,
% called "graph drawing parameters" in the following, can influence the
% way the algorithm works. For instance, an graph drawing parameter
% might be the average distance between vertices which the algorithm
% should take into account. Another example might be the fact the
% certain nodes are special nodes and that a certain edge should have
% a large label.
%
% These graph drawing parameters are different from "usual" pgf
% options: An alogrithmic parameter influenced the way the algorithm
% works, while usual options normally only influence how the result
% looks like. For instance, the fact that a node is red is not an
% graph drawing parameter (usually, at least), while the shape of a node
% might be an graph drawing parameter.
%
% There are three kinds of graph drawing parameters:
%
% 1) graph drawing graph parameters 
%    These parameters influence "the whole graph". An example
%    is the distance between vertices on the same level of a tree. 
%
% 2) graph drawing node parameters
%    These parameters are "attached" to a single node. This includes
%    options that are only meaningful in the context of a graph
%    drawing algorithm (like, say, the "mass" of a node in a
%    force-base algorith), but also hybrid attributed like the shape
%    of a node. The shape is important for pgf when it typesets the
%    node, but it may also be important for the graph drawing
%    algorithm since it might position circles differently from, say,
%    rectangles.
%    
% 3) graph drawing edge parameters
%    Similarly to nodes, edges can also have graph drawing
%    parameters. Also similarly to nodes, there can be purely
%    graph drawing parameters and also options that are hybrid.
%    
% You have to "declare" a graph drawing parameter similarly to a normal
% key, but instead of using the /.code, you use /.graph
% parameter, /.node parameter, and /.edge
% parameter. More details on how these handlers work is given below.
%
% Specifying the set of graph drawing parameters for a given graph or
% node or edge works as follows: When the graph drawing engine is
% started for a graph (using \pgfgdbeginscope), a snapshot is taken of
% all graph drawing graph parameters currently setup at this
% point. Similarly, when a node is created inside such a scope, a
% snapshot is taken of the set of all graph drawing node parameters in
% force at this point is taken and stored together with the
% node. Finally, when an edge is created, a snapshot of the setting of
% the graph drawing edge parameters is taken.
% 
% All of these option sets can easily be accessed inside the graph 
% drawing algorithms, see the documentation of the lua layer.

% Passing hybrid options
% 
% #1 = option's name
% #2 = option's value
% 
% Description:
%
% Some options, like "sibling distance", can both be considered as
% node options, but also as graph options, in which case they are
% supposed to apply to all nodes of the graph. Such options could, in
% principle, be passed to all nodes, but it much more economic to have
% them defined only once for the whole graph and, then, only store
% deviating values at special nodes.
%
% To facilitate this, you can declare that an option as a hybrid
% node/graph parameter or as a hybrif edge/graph parameter. For such
% parameters, the following happens: Whenever you set the parameter
% outside a graph drawing scope, it will be considered as a graph
% parameter, when you set it inside a graph drawing scope, it will be
% set as a node/edge parameter. This means that when you write, for
% instance, \graph [layered layout, sibling distance=1cm] 
% { a [sibling distance=2cm] -- b -- c }, the first "sibling distance"
% is a graph parameter (the graph drawing scope triggered by "layered
% layout" starts only after all options have been parsed), while the
% second "sibling distance" applies only to node "a".

% Key handler /.graph parameter
% 
% Description:

% drawing graph parameter (as explained above). Subsequently, setting
% this key will cause special internals to be setup so that graph
% drawing algorithms can access the value of this key easily and
% directly inside the lua layer.
% 
% A typical usage would be
%
%   /some path/my key/.graph parameter
%  
% Now, when people write /some path/my key=foo in their code, inside
% the algorithm the parameter "my key" would be set to "foo".

% Key handler /.parameter initial

% Description:
%
% Use this key handler instead of /.initial to assign an initial value
% to a graph parameter. What will happen is that on the Lua layer, the passed
% value is stored in a special table. Whenever the key is not
% explicitly set by the user, the value #1 will be used.
% 
% Note that
% 
%   /foo/.graph parameter, /foo=5
% 
% and
% 
%   /foo/.graph parameter, /foo/.parameter initial=5
%   
% have the same effect insofar as, in both cases, getOption ('/foo')
% will yield 5. The difference is that in the second case the TeX
% layer does not need to pass around huge lists of options and will,
% thus, be faster. In general, it is recommendable that initial values
% for graph drawing graph parameters are setup using this handler.
% 
% #1 is passed through the conversion of the key before being stored.

% In many cases, when you specify a graph parameter, you will not wish
% the "actual" setting of the key to be passed to the algorithm. For
% instance, suppose we write 
% 
%   /some path/width/.graph parameter
% 
% Now we could write /some path/width=20pt+2pt, and inside the
% algorithm the parameter "width" would equal the string
% "20pt+2pt". However, inside the algorithm, it would be somewhat
% preferable to have access to the value "22" rather than the string
% "20pt+2pt". Similary, when the width is "1in", the algorithm will
% prefer to get passed the number "72.27" instead of "1in".
% 
% For this reason, when you define a graph drawing parameter, you can
% optionally specify a conversion that will be applied to the
% key's value before it is passed to the algorithm. To do so, 
% write
% 
% /some path/my key/.graph parameter=conversion key
% 
% The conversion key will be executed with path prefix /graph
% drawing/conversions/. It gets passed the value that was
% assigned to the parameter key. It should store the "result" of the
% conversion in the macro \pgfgdresult. The contents of this macro is
% the text that will actually be passed down to the algorithm.
% 
% As an example, let us start with the default conversion: It simply
% stores its parameter as the result:
% 
% /graph drawing/conversions/string/.code=\def\pgfgdresult{'\luaescapestring{#1}'}

% Adds an edge to the graph
%
% #1 = first node
% #2 = second node
% #3 = edge direction
% #4 = edge options (will be executed in a protected environment)
% #5 = aux stuff (curtesy for TikZ -- edge nodes)
%
% Description:
%
% Creating an edge means that you tell the graph drawing algorithm
% that #1 and #2 are connected. The "kind" of connection is indicated
% by #3, which may be one of the following:
% 
% ->  = a directed edge (also known as an arc) from #1 to #2
% --  = an undirected edge between #1 and #2
% <-  = a directed edge from #2 to #1, but with the "additional hint"
%       that this is a "backward" edge. A graph drawing algorithm may
%       or may not take this hint into account
% <-> = a bi-directed edge between #1 and #2.
% 
%
% The parameters #4 and #5 are a bit more tricky. When an edge between
% two vertices of a graph is created via \pgfgdedge, nothing is
% actually done immediately. After all, without knowing the final
% positions of the nodes #1 and #2, there is no way of
% creating the actual drawing commands for the edge. Thus, the actual
% drawing of the edge is done only when the graph drawing algorithm is
% done (namely in the macro \pgfgdedgecallback, see later).
% 
% Because of this "delayed" drawing of edges, options that influence
% the edge must be retained until the moment when the edge is actually
% drawn. Parameters #4 and #5 store such options.
% 
% Let us start with #4. This parameter should be set to a list of
% key-value pairs like
% 
%   /tikz/.cd, color=red, very thick, this edge must be vertical
% 
% Some of these options may be of interest to the graph drawing
% algorithm (like the last option) while others will 
% only be important during the drawing of edge (like the first
% option). The options that are important for the graph drawing
% algorithm must be passed to the algorithm via setting keys that have
% been declared using the handler .edge parameter (see 
% above).
% 
% The tricky part is that options that are of interest to the graph
% drawing algorithm must be executed *before* the algorithm starts,
% but the options as a whole are usually only executed during the
% drawing of the edges, which is *after* the algorithm has finished.
% 
% To overcome this problem, the following happens:
% 
% The options in #4 are executed "tentatively" inside
% \pgfgdedge. However, this execution is done in a "heavily guarded
% sandbox" where all effects of the options (like changing the
% color or the line width) do not propagate beyond the sandbox. Only
% the changes of the graph drawing edge parameters leave the
% sandbox. These parameters are then passed down to the graph drawing
% engine.
% 
% Later, when the edge is drawn using \pgfgdedgecallback, the options #4
% are available once more and then they are executed normally.
%
% Note that when the options in #4 are executed, no path is
% preset. Thus, you typically need to start it with, say, /tikz/.cd.
%
%
% The text in #5 is some "auxilliary" text that is simply stored away
% and later directly to \pgfgdedgecallback. This is a curtesy to TikZ,
% which can use it to store its node labels. 
%
% Example:
%
% \pgfgdedge{A}{B}{->}{red}{}

% Helper keys for defining new graph drawing algorithms and their
% options  
% 
% Description:
% 
% When you hanve written a new graph drawing algorithm in lua (see the
% documentation for how this works), you need to make the higher
% levels aware of the algorithm and its parameters.
% 
% In principle, users could just write /graph drawing/algorithm=your
% algorithm's name and set options using for instance /graph
% drawing/your options=foo, but this would result in numerous
% repetitions of the prefix "/graph drawing/" in the code. Indeed, it
% would be somewhat preferable that users can just write things like
% 
% \tikz \graph [planar] { ... };
% 
% and have the option "planar" launch some fancy algorithm. However,
% "planar" will then have to have the path /tikz/graphs/planar, while
% the graph drawing algorithms expect their keys in  /graph drawing.
% 
% To overcome these difficulties, key forwarding is used. You declare
% you keys with the /graph drawing/ path, which is the "correct way"
% of declaring these keys, and then additionally setup keys in the
% /tikz/ and the /tikz/graphs/ paths that forward their values to the
% /graph drawing/ path. The helper functions below are intended to make
% this reasonably easy.
% 
%
% Graph parameters come in too flavours: "common" and
% "family-specific". A "common" graph parameter can be used by
% several graph drawing algorithms. An example are orientation keys,
% which can actually be applied to any graph in a postprocessing
% step. In contrast, "family-specific" keys are only important for
% one algorithm or only for algorithms from a small family of
% algorithms. For instance, a "stiffness" for spring layout algorithms
% would only apply to, well, spring layout algorithms.
% 
% The common graph parameters reside in the path /graph drawing/,
% while the family-specific graph parameters reside in the path /graph
% drawing/<family name>/. For common graph parameters, forwarding will
% be setup in paths like /tikz/ or /tikz/graphs, so you can use these
% keys directly. In contrast, no forwarding will be setup for
% family-specific keys. Rather, these keys can be passed to the
% algorithm's key, which will in turn executed the keys with the
% prefix /graph drawing/<family name>/.


% Declare keys for a new algorithm
% 
% #1 = algorithm's key name
% #2 = algorithm's family name
% #3 = options that configure the algorithm
% 
% Description:
% 
% This will setup the following keys:
% 
% /graph drawing/#1 is setup so that, when executed, the graph drawing
% algorithm is configured by the options in #3 and the value passed to
% are executed as keys with the path prefix /graph
% drawing/#2. Furthermore, the key /graph 
% drawing/at begin scope will be executed.This key does nothing by
% default, but it could be used to setup things (as is done in tikz)
% to start the graph drawing engine for the current scope.
%

%  
% When used with a node, the syntax is :angle:anther_node, causing the

% node has a slope of "angle"
% 
%   a[orient=:90:b] -- c -- b  % b will be above a.
%   
% The leading colon is optional, so orient=90:b is also fine.
%
% When used with a graph as a whole, the syntax is node1:angle:node2,
% with node1 being nonempty, causing the graph to be oriented so that
% the line from node1 to node2 has a slope of "angle"
% 
%  graph [orient=a:90:b] { a -- c -- b } % b will be above a.
%  
%  
% If a dash is found in the parameter, it will be replaced by :0:, so
% saying orient=a-b has the same effect as orient=a:0:b. A vertical

% Graph events  
% 
% Although a graph consists of nodes and edges, during the
% construction of the graph a lot of information concerning the
% structure of the graph is often available. For instance, as we
% specify a graph using the child-syntax, we do not only which edges
% are present, but we can implicitly specify an ordering on the
% nodes. Even more, there is even information availble concerning
% nodes that are not present at all: A child[missing] is not present
% as a node or an edge, but a tree drawing algorithm will want to know
% about this child nevertheless.
% 
% In order to communicate such information to the graph drawing
% engine, "events" are used. As a graph is created, in addition to
% nodes and edges, "events" may happen. The events come in a
% sequential order and they are stored together with the graph. For
% each node and each edge, its index in the event sequence is
% stored, that is, it is stored how many events happened before the
% node or edge was created.
% 
% Internally, an event consists of a name and, possibly, some
% parameters. When the parameter is created on the tikz level, it will
% be a string that is passed down to Lua. Internally created events
% will also have parameters that are objects.
% 
% Two events are a bit special since they get special internal
% support: The begin and end events. The first signals that some kind
% of group has started; which is closed by the corresponding end
% event. The "kind" of group is indicated by the parameter of the
% begin event.
% 
% 
% 
% Standard events are:
% 
% For each node entered into a graph, a "node" event is automatically
% created internally with the parameter being the node. However, you
% can also create this event yourself. In this case, the parameter
% will be a string and will mean that the node is "virtual" or
% "missing", but space should be reserved for it, if possible (this is
% use, for instance, by certain tree layouts).
% 
% For each edge entered into a graph, an "edge" event is automatically
% created, with the edge as the parameter. Again, an event with a
% string parameter corresponds to a "non-existing" node.
% 
%
% Standard event groups are:
% 
%
% The "descendants" event group include a set of nodes that, at least
% inside the specification, are descendants of the last node
%
% begin descendants
% ...
% end
% 
% 
% The "array" event group collects together some nodes in an array of
% nodes. This can be used, for instance, to specify matrices.
% 
% begin array

% Generate a node 
%
% This callback is called from the engine whenever an algorithm
% generates a new node internally.
%
% #1 = name of the node
% #2 = shape of the node
% #3 = options generated by the algorithm in key-value syntax. The set
% of generated options is algorithm-dependent.
% #4 = x position of the node (in pt)
% #5 = y position of the node
% #6 = text
%
% This is an internal function and will be called by the Lua engine
