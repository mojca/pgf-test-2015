-- @section subsection {Controlling and Configuring Force-Based Algorithms}
--
-- All force-based algorithms are based on
-- a general pattern which we detail in the following. Numerous options
-- can be used to influence the behaviour of this general pattern; more
-- specific options that apply only to individual algorithms are
-- explained along with these algorithms.
