       Limits the number of iterations of algorithms for force-based
       layouts to \meta{number}. 
      
       Depending on the characteristics of the input graph and the parameters
       chosen for the algorithm, minimizing the system energy may require
       many iterations. 
      
       In these situations it may come in handy to limit the number of
       iterations. This feature can also be useful to draw the same graph
       after different iterations and thereby demonstrate how the spring or
       spring-electrical algorithm improves the drawing step by step.
      
       The following example shows two drawings generated using two
       different |iteration| limits: 
       \begin{codeexample}[]
       \tikz \graph [spring layout, iterations=10]  { subgraph K_n [n=4] };
       \tikz \graph [spring layout, iterations=500] { subgraph K_n [n=4] };
       \end{codeexample}
      
       The same effect happens for all force-based algorithms:
       \begin{codeexample}[width=5cm]
       \tikz \graph [spring electrical layout, iterations=10]
         { subgraph K_n [n=4] };
       \tikz \graph [spring electrical layout, iterations=500]
         { subgraph K_n [n=4] };
       \end{codeexample}

declare {
  key  = "cooling factor",
  type = "number",
  initial = "0.95",

  documentation = [["  
       This parameter helps in controlling how layouts evolve over
       time. It is used to gradually reduce the step size 
       between one iteration to the next. A small positive cooling factor
       $\ge 0$ means that the movement of nodes is quickly or abruptly
       reduced, while a large cooling factor $\le 1$ allows for a smoother
       step by step layout refinement at the cost of more iterations. The
       following example demonstrates how a smaller cooling factor may
       result in a less balanced drawing. By default, Hu2006 spring,
       Hu2006 spring electrical, and Walshaw2000 spring electrical use a
       cooling factor of |0.95|.
       \begin{codeexample}[]
       \tikz \graph [spring layout, cooling factor=0.1]
       { a -> b -> c -> a };
       \end{codeexample}
       \begin{codeexample}[]

       { a -> b -> c -> a };

  documentation = [["  
       All spring and spring-electrical algorithms implemented in the
       thesis terminate as soon as the maximum movement of any node drops
       below $k \cdot \meta{tolerance}$. This tolerance factor can be changed
       with the convergence tolerance option:

         { { [clique] 1, 2 } -- 3 -- 4 -- { 5, 6, 7 } };
