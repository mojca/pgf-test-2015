       Once a graph drawing algorithm has determined positions for the nodes,
       they are drawn \emph{before} the edges are drawn; after
       all, it is hard to draw an edge between nodes when their positions
       are not yet known. However, we typically want the nodes to be
       rendered \emph{after} or rather \emph{on top} of the edges. For
       this reason, the default behaviour is that the nodes at their
       final positions are collected in a box that is inserted into the
       output stream only after the edges have been drawn -- which has
       the effect that the nodes will be placed ``on top'' of the
       edges.
      
       This behaviour can be changed using this option. When the key is
       invoked, nodes are placed \emph{behind} the edges.
