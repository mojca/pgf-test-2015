      Just like the |SimpleDemo| algorithm, this algorithm arranges
      the nodes of a graph in a circle (without paying heed to the sizes of the
      nodes or to the edges). Its main purpose is to show how C code
      can access the Lua representation of graphs. See
      Section~\ref{section-algorithms-in-c} of the manual for detais.
