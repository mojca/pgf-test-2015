--- The Digraph class
--
-- A digraph (directed graph) is a directed, simple graph (no
-- multiedges). Formally, it consistes of a set $V$ of vertices
-- together with a set $E \subseteq V \times V$ of edges, which we
-- call \emph{arcs}. Note that in a digraph all arcs are directed.
--
-- The implementation of a digraph is as follows: 
--
-- A vertex is a rather "big" object that keeps track of all sorts of
-- information (like which graphs it belongs to, possibly its position
-- on the page, information locally important for an algorithm and so
-- on). A vertex can be part of more than one graph. Vertices are
-- created first and then added or removed from graphs.
--
-- Graphs keep an array of vertices, the ordering is important (they
-- will be ordered according to the order in which they were
-- inserted). You can and should iterate over all vertices of a graph g
-- using the following code:
--
-- for _,v in ipairs(g.vertices) do
--   ...
-- end
--
-- Do not use pairs(g.vertices) because this may cause your graph
-- drawing algorithm to produce different outputs on different runs.
--
-- Never, ever, modify g.vertices directly, always use add and remove.
--
-- 
-- When a vertex v is added to a graph g, the entry v[g] is set to a
-- table that stores information concerning the vertex's "involvement"
-- in the graph. This table has the following fields:
--
--   index: The index of the node inside the vertices array of g.
--   incoming: A table storing the arcs pointing to the vertex (each
--    arc is stored twice, once at an array position and once at the
--    tail vertex).
--   outgoing: Same as incoming, only for the outgoing arcs.

--- Creates a new digraph.
--
-- A digraph object stores a set of vertices and a set of arcs. The
-- vertices table is both an array (for iteration) as well as a
-- hash-table of node to position mappings. This operation takes time
-- $O(1)$.

  end
end


--- Adds many vertices to a digraph.
--
-- There is no real advantage over just adding the vertices one by
--one; but this method is here for symmetry with removeMany
--

-- graph:

--- Remove a vertex from a digraph.
--
-- Removing a vertex from a graph in which it is no element is legal
-- and has no effect. 
--
-- This operation takes time $O(|V|)$ if the vertex is in the graph,
-- so it is pretty expensive. To remove many vertices, use removeMany
-- instead, which will be much faster than repeatedly calling remove.
--
-- @param v The vertex to be removed.

  if v[self] then

    table.remove (self.vertices, v[self].index)
    v[self] = nil
  end
end



--- Remove many vertices from a digraph
--
-- This method allows you to remove a whole list of vertices from the
-- graph. The main difference to calling remove repeatedly is that the
-- runtime will be linear in the number of vertices regardless of how
-- many vertices are deleted (plus the time needed to delete the arcs
-- to nodes that are not deleted).
--
-- This operation will take time $O(|V|)$ plus the time needed to
-- disconnect all deleted nodes.
--
-- @param delete_us An array of nodes that should be deleted.
--
function Digraph:removeMany(delete_us)
  local vertices = self.vertices
  
  -- Mark all to-be-deleted nodes
  for i=1,#delete_us do

  local target = 1
  for i=1,#vertices do
    local v = vertices[i]
    if v then
      if i > target then
	-- Move from i to target:
	vertices[target] = v
	v[self].index = target
      end
      target = target + 1
    end
  end
  
  for j=#vertices,target,-1 do
    vertices[j] = nil
  end
end




--- Create private tables for the graph and its vertices.
--
-- "Private tables" are tables that are available in each vertex and arc
-- of a graph (and also at the graph itself), indexed through a
-- "private" key, normally the key of a special table. The idea is
-- that, say, an algorithm will work on a graph and wishes to store
-- some information at the vertices. For instance, a depth-first
-- search might wish to store information like "this vertex is
-- marked" at a vertex. One could store this information simply in a
-- field like v.marked. However, a different algorithm might also use
-- this field, leading to confusion. To avoid this, an algorithm can
-- request that it should be provided with private tables at each node
-- (and also at the graph object itself, for convenience).
-- 
-- You can also request private tables for all arcs, but this is done
-- using a separate function for efficiency since many algorithms will
-- only need pivate tables at the vertices.
--
-- If a vertex already has a private table, it will not be
-- modified. Thus, you can call this method repeatedly, namely whenever
-- new nodes have been added.
--
-- The method takes time $O(|V|)$.
--
-- @param A private key (must be a table).

function Digraph:privateVertexTables(private)
  assert(type(private) == "table", "private keys must be tables")

  self[private] = self[private] or {}

  -- Add an algorithm field to all vertices
  local vertices=self.vertices
  for i=1,#vertices do
    local v = vertices[i]
    v[private] = v[private] or {}
  end
end


--- Creates private tables for the arcs of a graph
--
-- Like privateVertexTables, only for arcs rather then vertices. As
-- for privateVertexTables, the graph object itself also gets a private
-- table.
--
-- This method takes time $O(|V| + |E|)$, where $E$ is the set of
-- arcs.
--
-- @param A private key (must be a table).

function Digraph:privateArcTables(private)
  assert(type(private) == "table", "private keys must be tables")

  self[private] = self[private] or {}

  -- Add an algorithm field to all arcs
  local vertices = self.vertices
  for i=1,#vertices do
    local out = vertices[i][self].outgoing
    for j=1,#out do
      local a = out[j]
      a[private] = a[private] or {}
    end
  end
end



--- Returns a string representation of this graph including all nodes and edges.
--
-- @return Digraph as string.

  local vstrings = {}
  local astrings = {}
  for i,v in ipairs(self.vertices) do
    vstrings[i] = tostring(v)

    if #out_arcs > 0 then
      local t = {}
      for j,a in ipairs(out_arcs) do
	t[j] = tostring(a.head)
      end
      astrings[#astrings + 1] = "  " .. vstrings[i] .. " -> { " .. table.concat(t,", ") .. " }"
