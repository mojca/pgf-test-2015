--- The Digraph class
--
-- A digraph (directed graph) is a directed, simple graph (no
-- multiedges). Formally, it consistes of a set $V$ of vertices
-- together with a set $E \subseteq V \times V$ of edges, which we
-- call \emph{arcs}. Note that in a digraph all arcs are directed.
--
-- The implementation of a digraph is as follows: 
--
--
-- 1. Vertices
--
-- A vertex is a rather "big" object that keeps track of all sorts of
-- information (like which graphs it belongs to, possibly its position
-- on the page, information locally important for an algorithm and so
-- on). A vertex can be part of more than one graph. Vertices are
-- created first and then added or removed from graphs.
--
-- Graphs keep an array of vertices, the ordering is important (they
-- will be ordered according to the order in which they were
-- inserted). You can and should iterate over all vertices of a graph g
-- using the following code:
--
-- for i,v in ipairs(g.vertices) do
--   ...
-- end
--
-- Do not use pairs(g.vertices) because this may cause your graph
-- drawing algorithm to produce different outputs on different runs.
--
-- Never, ever, modify g.vertices directly, always use add and remove.
--
-- 
-- When a vertex v is added to a graph g, the entry v[g] is set to a
-- table that stores information concerning the vertex's "involvement"
-- in the graph. This table has the following fields:
--
--   incoming: A table storing the arcs pointing to the vertex (each
--    arc is stored twice, once at an array position and once at the
--    tail vertex).
--   outgoing: Same as incoming, only for the outgoing arcs.
--
--
-- 2. Arcs
--
-- Normally, you access the list of incoming or outgoing arcs of a
-- vertex using g:incoming(n) or g:outgoing(n). You can thus iterate
-- over all arcs of graph like this:
--
-- for _,v in ipairs(g.vertices) do
--   for _,a in ipairs(g:outgoing(v)) do
--    ...
--   end
-- end
--
-- However, it will often be more convenient and, in case the there
-- are far less arcs than node, also faster to write
-- 
-- for _,a in ipairs(g.arcs) do
--   ...
-- end
--
-- The arcs field is, however, a virtual field. What actually happens
-- is that, normally, when you access g.arcs, you actually get the
-- internal array _arcs, which accumulates all arcs in an array. However,
-- when you delete an arc, _arcs field will be set to nil. The next
-- time the arcs field is accessed, we notice that _arcs is nil an
-- recalculate it.
--
-- All of this means the following: As long as you do not delete arcs
-- from a graph, accessing the arcs field will be easier and faster
-- than the nested loops earlier. When you delete one or more arcs,
-- the next time the arcs field is accessed, it will need time linear
-- in the number of arcs in the graph plus then number of vertices to
-- recalculate the field. Thus, it is recommendable that you bundle
-- together disconnect calls.

--- Creates a new digraph.
--                
-- A digraph object stores a set of vertices and a set of arcs. The
-- vertices table is both an array (for iteration) as well as a
-- hash-table of node to position mappings. This operation takes time
-- $O(1)$. 
--
-- @param initial A table of initial values. It is permissible that
--                this array contains a "vertices" field. In this
--                case, this field must be an array and its entries
--                must be nodes, which will be inserted. If initial
--                has an arcs field or a storage field, these fields
--                will be ignored.
--                The table must contain a field "syntactic_digraph",
--                which should normally be the syntactic digraph of
--                the graph, but may also be the string "self", in
--                which case it will be set to the newly created
--                (syntactic) digraph.
--
-- The bottom line is that Digraph.new(existing_digraph) will create a
-- new digraph with the same vertex set and the same options as the
-- existing digraph, but without arcs.

--- Reconnect: An arc is changed so that instead of connecting a.tail

-- copied. Reconnecting and arc in the same way as before has no
-- effect.
