-- results of C to Lua.

-- Prepares a graph for use in C. The native data structures used in
-- Lua to represent graphs are not ideally suited for use in C, so a
-- bit of simplification and adaption is done to facilitate the
-- interface between Lua and C. This function gets a |Digraph| object
-- as input and returns a new table |t| that will hopefully be useful
-- to C code. Furthermore, it also returns a partially filled table
-- |unbridge| that can be passed to the |unbridgeGraph| function
-- (however, the |unbridge| table needs to be filled with further
-- values to actually change the graph, see the |unbridgeGraph|
-- function for details).
--
-- Let us start with the graph's |vertices| array. For this array, the
-- table |t| will contain an field |vertices_for_c| which is an array
-- of tables with the following fields:
--
-- \begin{itemize}
-- \item |vertex| A |Vertex| object.
-- \item |vertex_index| The index of the object in the graph's
-- |vertices| array.
-- \item |pos| The |vertex| object's |pos| (a |Coordinate|).
-- \item |width| The width of the vertex. In the graph drawing system,
-- we use a ``richer'' notion of node shape (we work with a whole
-- convex hull), while C systems (like \textsc{ogdf}) way use |width|
-- and |height| fields. We do a best effort job to translate here.
-- \item |height| The vertex's height.
-- \item |shape| The vertex's shape.
-- \item |kind| The vertex's kind.
-- \item |weight| The value of the |weight| field of the |options| table.
-- \item |options_index| The index of the vertex's option table. See the
-- explanation on option tables later on.
-- \end{itemize}
--
-- The next array is the |syntactic_edges_for_c| array. As the name
-- suggests, it stores all syntatic edges of the graph in a manner
-- useful for C. Each entry is a table with the following fields:
--
-- \begin{itemize}
-- \item |syntatic_edge| The |Edge| object.
-- \item |syntatic_edge_index| The index of the |Edge| object inside
-- the |Arc|'s array of syntactic edges.
-- \item |arc| The |Arc| object (which contains the |Edge| object).
-- \item |arc_index| The index of the arc object in the graph's |arcs|
-- array. 
-- \item |tail_index| An index into the |vertices_for_c| array of the
-- edge's tail object.
-- \item |head_index| Similar, but for the head.
-- \item |path| The path array of the edge.
-- \item |direction| The edge's kind (one of the strings |"--"|, |"->"|,
-- |"<-"|, |"<->"|, |"-!-"|).
-- \item |weight| The value of the |weight| field of the |options| table.
-- \item |options_index| The index of the edge's option table. See
-- below.
-- \end{itemize}
--
-- The next field, |options_for_c|, is an array of options
-- tables. In Lua, the vertices and edges just store pointers to their
-- option tables and many vertices or edges can share the same
-- table. We also want these vertices and edges to share the
-- reflection of these tables in C, but for this we need to know which
-- tables are the same. This array provides this information by
-- storing each table just once.
--
-- The final fields of |t| are |syntactic_digraph|, which just stores
-- the |graph| object, and |options|, which stores the graph's options
-- table. 
--
-- @param graph The input graph.
-- @param algorithm Optionally, an algorithm object. If non |nil|, we
-- attempt to get the bounding box information of the vertices from
-- the storage object attached to the vertices (this is important only
-- for algorithms that draw layered graphs and wish to profit from the
-- automatic node rotation).
-- @return The table |t| as decribed above.
-- @return A table |unbridge| that contains an empty array for each
-- field expected by the |unbridgeGraph| function. It is the job of
-- the C code to fill these tables.

-- Update the data structure of a graph from values returned from C.
--
-- This method is called after C has run and updated its C
-- data structures. The gathered information will then have
-- accumulated in a number of arrays, which are stored in the second
-- parameter and which are used to update the graph object.
--
-- The first three array fields are used to update the vertex array:
--
-- \begin{itemize}
-- \item |vertex_indices| Each entry stores the index of a
-- to-be-updated vertex in the |vertices| array.
-- \item |x| This array contains the computed $x$-coordinates of the
-- corresponding vertices.
-- \item |y| The array of |y| coordinates.
-- \end{itemize}
--
-- The next arrays are used to update the edges:
-- \begin{itemize}
-- \item |arc_indices| An array of the indices of the arc objects in
-- the graph's |arcs| array to which these entries refer.
-- \item |syntactic_edge_indices| The subentries in the arc object's
-- array of syntactic edges.
-- \item |bends| An array of edge paths. Each path is an array of
-- ``path objects'', which are either strings or a
-- table with the two fields |x| and |y| (but need not be a
-- |Coordinate| object, to make things a bit simpler for C). The array
-- will be copied.
-- \end{itemize}
--
-- Currently, this function will neither produce new edges nor new
-- vertices, but this will change.
--
-- @param graph The syntactic digraph that should be updated.
-- @param t The table that contains the above arrays as fields.
