-- It implements algorithms for computing distances between nodes of a graph 
-- (in the sense of path lengths).

--- Performs the Dijkstra algorithm to solve the single-source shortes path problem.
--
-- The algorithm computes the shortest paths from \meta{source} to all nodes 
-- in the graph. It also generates a table with distance level sets, each of 
-- which  contain all nodes that have the same corresponding distance to 
-- \meta{source}. Finally, a mapping of nodes to their parents along the
-- shortest paths is generated to allow the reconstruction of the paths
-- that were chosen by the Dijkstra algorithm.
--
-- @param graph  The graph to compute the shortest paths for.
-- @param source The node to compute the distances to.
--
-- @return A mapping of nodes to their distance to \meta{source}. 
-- @return An array of distance level sets. The set at index |i| contains
--         all nodes that have a distance of |i| to \meta{source}.
-- @return A mapping of nodes to their parents to allow the reconstruction
--         of the shortest paths chosen by the Dijkstra algorithm.

--- Computes the pseudo diameter of a graph.
--
-- The diameter of a graph is the maximum of the shortest paths between
-- any pair of nodes in the graph. A pseudo diameter is an approximation
-- of the diameter that is computed by picking a starting node |u| and
-- finding a node |v| that is farthest away from |u| and has the smallest
-- degree of all nodes that have the same distance to |u|. The algorithm
-- continues with |v| as the new starting node and iteratively tries
-- to find an end node that is generates a larger pseudo diameter.
-- It terminates as soon as no such end node can be found.
--
-- @param graph The graph.
--
-- @return The pseudo diameter of the graph.
-- @return The start node of the corresponding approximation of a maximum
--         shortest path.
-- @return The end node of that path.
