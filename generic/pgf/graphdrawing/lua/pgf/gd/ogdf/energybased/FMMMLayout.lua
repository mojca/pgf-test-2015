      |FMMMLayout| implements a force-directed graph drawing
      method suited also for very large graphs. It is based on a
      combination of an efficient multilevel scheme and a strategy for
      approximating the repulsive forces in the system by rapidly
      evaluating potential fields.
 
      The implementation is based on the following publication:
