--- This file contains a number of standard graph algorithms such as Dijkstra.

pgf.module("pgf.graphdrawing")



algorithms = {}



--- Performs the Dijkstra algorithm to solve the single-source shortes path problem.
--
-- The algorithm computes the shortest paths from \meta{source} to all nodes 
-- in the graph. It also generates a table with distance level sets, each of 
-- which  contain all nodes that have the same corresponding distance to 
-- \meta{source}. Finally, a mapping of nodes to their parents along the
-- shortest paths is generated to allow the reconstruction of the paths
-- that were chosen by the Dijkstra algorithm.
--
-- @param graph  The graph to compute the shortest paths for.
-- @param source The node to compute the distances to.
--
-- @return A mapping of nodes to their distance to \meta{source}. 
-- @return An array of distance level sets. The set at index |i| contains
--         all nodes that have a distance of |i| to \meta{source}.
-- @return A mapping of nodes to their parents to allow the reconstruction
--         of the shortest paths chosen by the Dijkstra algorithm.
