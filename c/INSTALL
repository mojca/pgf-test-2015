In order to use the C code in these directories, you should first
modify / setup the file config/LocalMakefileConfig.mk, which is
included by the main Makefiles and allows you to overwrite the
settings from config/Makefile.mk.

Once this is done, run make.

You must then copy / link the resulting shared libraries with their
full paths into the "luatex/lib" subdirectory of the directory where your TeX
executable resides. For instance, if the luatex program is in

/usr/texbin

then you would put SimpleDemoC.so into

/usr/texbin/lib/luatex/lua/pgf/gd/examples/c


Alternatively, create a softlink from /usr/texbin/lib/luatex/pgf to
... /pgf/c/graphdrawing/pdf.
