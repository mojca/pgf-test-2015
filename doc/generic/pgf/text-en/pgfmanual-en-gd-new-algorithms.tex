\subsection{A First Example}

This section presents a simple example of how a graph drawing
algorithm can be implemented. For each graph drawing algorithm
there must be a class of the name given to the |algorithm| key. This
class should usually reside in a file called
|pgfgd-algorithm-|\meta{algorithm name}. This class must provide (at
least) the two methods |new| and |run|. Each time a layout needs to
be computed for a graph, a new object of this algorithm class is
instantiated using the class's |new| method. For the newly created
object, an attribute |graph| will be set to an object representing the
graph. Then, the |constructor| method of the object is called,
provided it exists. Then, the |run| method is called, which should do
the actual work. (The separation into a constructor and a run method
is purely for convenience.) The |run| method should modify the
coordinates of the nodes of its |graph| attribute.

To simplify the creating of classes and constructors, the graph
drawing engine provides the function |pgf.gd.new_algorithm_class|, which
takes a table of infos about the algorithm as input and will create a
class and a |new| method for you.

As a complete example, the following code fragment implements a
trivial graph drawing algorithm that just places all nodes on a
fixed-size circle.  It is accessed with the name 
|SimpleDemo|.

\pgfgddeclareforwardedkeys{/graph drawing}{
  radius/.graph parameter=evaluate math expression,
  radius/.parameter initial=1cm,
  node radius/.node parameter=evaluate math expression
}

\begin{codeexample}[code only]
-- File SimpleDemo.lua

local SimpleDemo = pgf.gd.new_algorithm_class {}

function SimpleDemo:run()
  local radius = 28.908  -- this is 1cm in points
  local alpha = (2 * math.pi) / #self.graph.nodes
  for i=1,#self.graph.nodes do
    self.graph.nodes[i].pos.x = radius * math.cos((i-1) * alpha)
    self.graph.nodes[i].pos.y = radius * math.sin((i-1) * alpha)
  end
end

return SimpleDemo  
\end{codeexample}

The algorithm computes a circular layout like in the following.

\tikz [graph drawing scope, /graph drawing/algorithm=pgf.gd.examples.SimpleDemo]
  \graph { f -> c -> e -> a -> {b -> {c, d, f}, e -> b}};

\begin{codeexample}[code only]
\tikz [graph drawing scope, /graph drawing/algorithm=SimpleDemo]
  \graph { f -> c -> e -> a -> {b -> {c, d, f}, e -> b}};
\end{codeexample}


\subsection{Lua Layer: Overview}

All of the graph drawing engine resides in the directory
|graphdrawing| of |pgf|. Inside, there are the following
subdirectories:

\begin{itemize}
\item |tex|, with the \pgfname\ and \tikzname\ library files and
\item |lua|, with all the Lua code, including both support files and
  actual algorithms.
\end{itemize}

TODO: Details...

drawing algorithms are implemented in Lua, these directories also
contain mainly Lua files, ...

The job of this library is to make the graph
parameters of the algorithms visible to \pgfname, so this file
typically just contains calls of |\pgfgddeclarealgorithmkey| and
|\pgfgddeclareforwardedkeys|.

In the following, we first describe which steps are necessary to
implement a new graph drawing algorithm. We then have a look at the
classes made available to graph drawing algorithms by the
engine. Finally, the section concludes with a class and function
reference.



\subsection{Lua Layer: Installing Graph Drawing Algorithms}
\label{section-gd-implementing-algorithms}

In the following we describe in detail how a new graph drawing
algorithm can be implemented and installed. 


\subsubsection{Starting the Graph Drawing Engine}

First, before any graph drawing algorithms can be used, the graph
drawing engine needs to be loaded. This is done by loading the
\pgfname\ library |pgflibrarygraphdrawing|. This will
initialise the Lua graph drawing subsystem by invoking the Lua loader
class.   

In the most basic cases, no further \TeX\ code needs to be written to
use a new graph drawing algorithm; but we will see later on, that a
small entry in an appropriate \pgfname\ library of graph drawing
algorithms will make the use of the algorithm somewhat simpler.


\subsubsection{Main File of the Graph Drawing Algorithm}

As indicated at in the description of the |algorithm| key on
page~\ref{section-gd-algorithm-key}, each graph drawing algorithm  
must be implemented in a class. The class name will be the value
passed to the |algorithm| key, albeit without any spaces. This class
is a normal class in the sense of Lua and it will be loaded by calling
|require| on the value. The class file must return the class.

During |\pgfgdendscope|, the algorithm's class will be loaded, if
necessary. Then, the following things happen, in turn, in normal
operation mode: (Let \meta{class} by the class name.)

\begin{enumerate}
\item Some preprocessing is done, if the ``static'' attributes of the
  class specify this.
\item A new instance of the class is created by calling
  \meta{class}|:new(graph)|, where |graph| is a variable holding the
  graph object. 
\item The |run| method of the instance is called. This method should now
  compute ``good'' positions for the nodes in the graph represented by
  the |graph|.
\item Post layout operations are performed, namely orienting the
  graph and then anchoring the graph. Both operations are performed
  automatically, but it is possible to configure them.
\end{enumerate}

TODO: Work on this:

Let us now look at the |graph_drawing_algorithm| function in more
detail. It takes a single parameter \meta{info}, which must be a
table, and does the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item It declares a new class.
\item It declares a |new| method for this class, which takes two
  parameters |g| and |algo| and returns a new \meta{instance} of the
  class. The first parameter will be installed in the attribute
  |graph| of \meta{instance}, the second in the |parent_algorithm|
  attribute. The |new| method tests whether a key called 
  |graph_options| is defined in the \meta{info} table. If so, the
  value for this key must be a table of \meta{options}. This table is
  processed as follows: For each pair \meta{key} |=| \meta{value}
  inside the \meta{options} table, an attribute \meta{key} is created
  in \meta{instance}. The \meta{value} may contain a \meta{type} at
  the end in square brackets. If \meta{type} is |string|, then the
  following happens:
  \begin{quote}
    |graph:getOption('/graph drawing/' .. |\meta{value}|)|
  \end{quote}
  For \meta{type} being |boolean|, the option is first converted to a
  boolean, similarly for \meta{type} being |number|. For \meta{type}
  being |algorithm| or |require| or |load|, the option must store the
  name of a file. This file will be loaded using |require| and the
  result is stored in the key.
\item If the key |properties| is defined inside the \meta{info} table,
  its value should be table of ``static'' or ``default'' values for
  the class. More precisely, this table is used as the metatable of
  the class.
\end{enumerate}

Let us have a look at an example: We redo our |SimpleDemo|, but this
time using the full power of the |graph_drawing_algorithm| function:

\begin{codeexample}[code only]
local SimpleDemo = pgf.gd.new_algorithm_class = {
  
  -- Declare a property:
  properties = {
    -- Ensures, that the graph is always connected when the graph
    -- drawing algorithm is called
    works_only_on_connected_graphs = true
  },

  -- Declare a graph parameter:
  graph_parameters = {
    label  = 'label [string]',
    radius = 'radius [number]',
  }
}
\end{codeexample}

The code is equivalent to the following:
\begin{codeexample}[code only]
local SimpleDemo = { works_only_on_connected_graphs = true }
SimpleDemo.__index = SimpleDemo

function SimpleDemo:new(g)
  local obj = { graph = g }
  setmetatable(obj, SimpleDemo)
  
  obj.label  = g:getOption('/graph drawing/label')
  obj.radius = tonumber(g:getOption('/graph drawing/radius'))
  
  return obj  
end  
\end{codeexample}



\subsubsection{Coordinate Systems in Lua}

\label{section-gd-lua-coordinates}

The main job of a graph drawing algorithm is to modify the
coordinates of the nodes of the graph object in the |graph|
attribute. Before we have a look at how this can be done, let us 
first clarify how the different coordinate systems of \pgfname\
interact with the graph drawing engine.

Let us start with the case that there is no special transformation
matrix setup is setup. In this case, all coordinates inside the Lua
layer are pairs of numbers that will be interpreted as dimensions in
\TeX\ points (one \TeX\ point equals 1/72.27 inches). The first number
will be interpreted as the $x$-coordinate (going right) and the second
number will be interpreted as the $y$-coordinate (going up). This is
true both for the bounding boxes of the nodes that are passed down to
the Lua layer, but also also for the coordinates that are computed by
the algorithms inside the Lua layer.

When graph parameters are set using the |evaluate math expression|
syntax, the dimensions will already have been converted into this
coordinate system. For instance, when a user writes
|node distance=1in|, then |getOption('/graph drawing/node distance')|
will yield the string |'72.27'|.

When a transformation matrix is
set, such as a shift by 1cm to the right and a rotation by
30$^\circ$, the following happens: At the beginning of a
graph drawing scope, the transformation matrix is reset. Thus, for
instance all nodes created inside the graph drawing scope for which no
scaling or shifting is setup will be centered on the origin. When
|\pgfgdendscope| is reached, the transformation matrix is immediately
restored, \emph{prior} to inserting the nodes at the computed
positions. This means, in particular, that the coordinates computed by
the graph drawing algorithms will be transformed by the transformation
matrix that was in force at the beginning of the graph drawing
scope. Continuing the example, all coordinates computed by the graph
drawing algorithms would be shifted by 1cm and then rotated by
30$^\circ$.

The bottom line is that graph drawing algorithms do not need to worry
about \pgfname's transformation matrix.



\subsubsection{Example of a Graph Drawing Algorithm's Code}

The following code fragment (taken and slightly altered
from the file |pgfgd-algorithm-SimpleDemo.lua|)
implements a trivial graph drawing algorithm that just places all
nodes on a fixed-size circle.  

\pgfgddeclareforwardedkeys{/graph drawing}{
  radius/.graph parameter=evaluate math expression
}
\pgfgdset{radius/.parameter initial=1cm}


\begin{codeexample}[code only]
local SimpleDemo = pgf.gd.new_algorithm_class {}

function SimpleDemo:run()
  local radius = 28.908  -- this is 1cm in points
  local nodeCount = table.count_pairs(self.graph.nodes)

  local alpha = (2 * math.pi) / nodeCount
  for i,node in ipairs(self.graph.nodes) do
    -- the interesting part...
    node.pos.x = radius * math.cos(i * alpha)
    node.pos.y = radius * math.sin(i * alpha)
  end
end

return SimpleDemo
\end{codeexample}


\subsubsection{Setting Up a Key for Selecting the Algorithm}

Users will typically wish to write something shorter than
|graph drawing scope...| in order to run a graph drawing algorithm on
a graph. For this reason, you should setup a style on the \TeX\ side
that calls the above keys. For instance, you could create a small
\tikzname\ library and place the following in the library:

\begin{codeexample}[code only]
\tikzset{circle layout/.style={
    graph drawing scope,
    /graph drawing/algorithm=SimpleDemo}}
\end{codeexample}

However, there is a better command for this:

\begin{codeexample}[code only]
% Place this in a file like pgflibrarygraphdrawing.circular.code.tex
\pgfgddeclarealgorithmkey
{circle layout}
{circle layout}
{algorithm=SimpleDemo}
\end{codeexample}
\pgfgddeclarealgorithmkey
{circle layout}
{circle layout}
{algorithm=pgf.gd.examples.SimpleDemo}

The |\pgfgddeclarealgorithmkey| takes care of setting up your style
key in appropriate ways (including some ways you will not have thought
of) and installs some additional handlers.


\subsubsection{Setting Up Graph Parameters}

Returning to the algorithm, it would be better if we could
``configure'' the radius of the circle. The graph drawing engine
provides for this case: You can declare certain \pgfname\ keys to be
so-called ``graph parameters''. When a key is declared as a graph
parameter, it will be available inside the algorithm: 

\begin{codeexample}[code only]
local radius = tonumber(self.graph:getOption("/graph drawing/radius"))
\end{codeexample}

Using the |getOption| method we obtain the value of the
graph parameter, but we must first register the key on the \TeX\ side
as follows: 

\begin{codeexample}[code only]
\pgfgddeclareforwardedkeys{/graph drawing}{
  radius/.graph parameter=evaluate math expression,
  radius/.parameter initial=1cm
}
\end{codeexample}

The |evaluate math expression| tells \TeX\ that whenever you assign
something to the |radius| option, the mathematical expression should
be evaluated and the result should be passed down to the graph drawing
algorithm. For instance, when you write |radius=20pt+3.5pt|, the
algorithm will get the value |23.5| as a result to calling
|getOption|. The |getOption| function will return a |nil| value for
keys that have not been set. While this sometimes is desired
behaviour, in our example we would want the radius to be set to a
default value (1cm in this case) when nothing has been specified. This
is achieved by the second line. The result of the above modifications
can be seen in the following example:

\begin{codeexample}[]
\tikz \graph [circle layout, radius=1.5cm]
  {f -> c -> e ->[bend right] a -> {b -> {c, d, f}, e -> b}};
\end{codeexample}

Since graph parameters are used quite frequently, there is special
support for them: In the declaration of class via
|pgf.gd.new_algorithm_class|, you can provide a key
|graph_parameters|. This key will take a table of key--value pairs,
where the key is interpreted as an attribute of the algorithm object
and the value is a string possibly suffixed by a type of the parameter
in square brackets. The string is interpreted as the name of a graph
parameter (without the |/graph drawing/| part of the path) and the
attribute will be setup to the value of this graph parameter, possibly
after a typecast. For our example, we would write:

\begin{codeexample}[code only]
local SimpleDemo = pgf.gd.new_algorithm_class {
  graph_parameters = { radius = "radius [number]" }
}
\end{codeexample}
In the main program, we can now write |self.radius|.

In addition to graph parameters, we can also have \emph{node
  parameters}. These are setup similarly to |.graph parameter|, but
with |.node parameter| and they are then accessed via the
|node:getOption| function.

As a slightly artificial example, let us introduce a |node radius|
key, which allows us to change the radius of a single node. For this,
we check for a node whether its radius key is set:

\begin{codeexample}[code only]
-- In SimpleDemo.lua:

  for i,node in ipairs(self.graph.nodes) do
    -- the interesting part...
    local node_radius = tonumber(node:getOption('/graph drawing/node radius')
                                 or self.radius)
    node.pos.x = node_radius * math.cos(i * alpha)
    node.pos.y = node_radius * math.sin(i * alpha)
  end
   
% In pgflibrarygraphdrawing.circle.code.tex
\pgfgddeclareforwardedkeys{/graph drawing}{
  node radius/.node parameter=evaluate math expression
}
\end{codeexample}
\pgfgddeclareforwardedkeys{/graph drawing}{
  node radius/.node parameter=evaluate math expression
}

\begin{codeexample}[]
\tikz \graph [circle layout]
  { a -> b -> c -> d [node radius=2cm] -> e -> a };
\end{codeexample}

Here is the complete code of the final algorithm:
\begin{codeexample}[code only]
-- File SimpleDemo.lua

local SimpleDemo = pgf.gd.new_algorithm_class {
  graph_parameters = { radius = "radius [number]" }
}

function SimpleDemo:run()
  local alpha = (2 * math.pi) / #self.graph.nodes
  for i,node in ipairs(self.graph.nodes) do
    -- the interesting part...
    local node_radius = tonumber(node:getOption('/graph drawing/node radius')
                                 or self.radius)
    node.pos.x = node_radius * math.cos(i * alpha)
    node.pos.y = node_radius * math.sin(i * alpha)
  end
end
   
return SimpleDemo  
\end{codeexample}

\begin{codeexample}[code only]
% File pgflibrarygraphdrawing.circle.code.tex
  
\pgfgddeclarealgorithmkey
  {circle layout}
  {circle layout}
  {algorithm=SimpleDemo}

\pgfgddeclareforwardedkeys{/graph drawing}{
  radius/.graph parameter=evaluate math expression,
  radius/.parameter initial=1cm,
  node radius/.node parameter=evaluate math expression
}
\end{codeexample}




\subsection{Lua Layer: Pre- and Postprocessing}

A number of tasks in graph drawing can be performed independently of
the actual algorithm used. For instance, many algorithms require that
the graph is connected. In this case, unconnected input graphs first
need to be decomposed into their connected components, which should
then be processed independently. Such a step would be
\emph{preprocessing} step. Similarly, once a graph has been laid out
by an algorithm, it often still needs to be shifted around to its
anchoring position. This step is the same for any algorithm and can be
done in a \emph{postprocessing} step.

It turns out that some pre- or postprocessing steps make sense for
certain algorithms, but not for other algorithms. For this reason, an
algorithm can specify which steps should (not) be performed by setting
certain attributes in the algorithm's class. Usually, these attributes
will be set using the |properties| key in the declaration of the
algorithm's class.

In the following, we describe which steps are performed and which keys
influence them.


\subsubsection{Preprocessing}

The following preprocessing steps are performed for every graph:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If the |works_only_on_connected_graphs| property is set, the
  connected components of the graph will first be computed.
\item For each component or, if the property is not set, for the whole
  graph, a new algorithm object is created.
\item The |run| method is then called for each component,
  \emph{unless} the size of the component is |1|. If, however, the
  |run_also_for_single_node| property is set, the algorithm is even
  invoked for a 1-node graph.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Postprocessing}

Each time the |run| method finishes, the following postprocessing
operations are performed:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The graph is oriented, see
  Section~\ref{subsection-library-graphdrawing-standard-orientation}. A
  graph drawing algorithm can set the |growth_direction| property in
  case the graph has a natural growth direction.
\item The graph is anchored, see
  Section~\ref{subsection-library-graphdrawing-anchoring}. 
\end{enumerate}
The above steps are applied to each connected component individually
if the splitting key has been set.

The components then need to be ``packed'', but this is not yet
implemented.




\subsection{Lua Layer: The Main Classes}

In the following, details of the different main classes that are
useful for graph drawing algorithms are documented.


\subsubsection{The Graph Class}

The class |Graph| is used to represent graphs and contains
references to the nodes and edges stored in a graph.

A graph drawing algorithm gets passed a |Graph| object that represents
the to-be-layouted graph. However, you can also create new graph
objects, for instance to decompose the graph into connected
components. 

To create a new graph, you can use the |copy| method, which creates a 
shallow copy (without coying nodes or edges), and the
|subGraphParent| method, which creates a deep copy of the graph, edge
and node objects starting at a designated parent node. If you need
more control by supplying your own set of already visited nodes, use
the underlying function |subGraph|.

A graph allows you to add and remove nodes and edges via |addNode|,
|addEdge|, |removeNode| and |removeEdge| respectively.  There are also
variants which remove all incident edges on a node removal and
conversely, |deleteNode| and |deleteEdge|.

Nodes can be looked up by name with |findNode|. The more generic
|findNodeIf| allows you to search for a node passing a test
predicate. 

The |walkDepth| and |walkBreadth| methods may be used to get
iterators over all nodes and edges in a depth-first or breadth-first
order (other traversal orders may require a rewrite or extension of the
|walkAux| method).

Positions are represented using the class |Vector|.

The following tasks are typical for manipulating the graph.

\begin{itemize}
\item Iterate over all nodes.
\begin{codeexample}[code only]
for node in table.value_iter(self.graph.nodes) do
   ...
end
\end{codeexample}
\item Get width or height of a node:
\begin{codeexample}[code only]
local width, height = node.width, node.height
\end{codeexample}
\item Get or set the coordinates of a node. The final values of these
  coordinates will be used during as the actual positions of the nodes
  on the page.
\begin{codeexample}[code only]
node.pos.x = node.pos.x + 1
node.pos.y = node.pos.y + 1
\end{codeexample}
\item Iterate over all edges and all nodes of the current edge.
\begin{codeexample}[code only]
for _,edge in ipairs(self.graph.edges) do
   for _,node in ipairs(edge.nodes) do
      ...
   end
end
\end{codeexample}
\item Get the nodes connected by an edge.
\begin{codeexample}[code only]
local nodeLeft = edge.nodes[1]
local nodeRight = edge.nodes[2]
\end{codeexample}
\end{itemize}

%
%\input{generated/pgflibrarygraphdrawing-traversal-helpers}



\subsubsection{Nodes}

Nodes serve as direct representations of the \TeX\ level nodes and
include information about incident edges, the calculated position and
the \TeX\ box used.  Typically one'll use its methods to navigate
through the graph or to add and remove edges in an intermediary graph.
Using the information from the \TeX\ side, this class is also able to
provide layout information, i.e. the dimensions of the corresponding
\TeX\ box.

%\input{generated/pgflibrarygraphdrawing-node}


\subsubsection{The Edge Class}

|Edge| objects contain references to incident nodes, including the
possibility to create hyperedges with more than two nodes for an edge.
Edges can be undirected or directed (denoted by the constants
|Edge.UNDIRECTED| or |Edge.LEFT|, |Edge.RIGHT|, |Edge.BOTH| and
|Edge.NONE| for invisible edges, see |Interface:drawEdge|). 

%\input{generated/pgflibrarygraphdrawing-edge}


\subsubsection{Positions and Vectors}

TT: More documentation is needed here!

%\input{generated/pgflibrarygraphdrawing-position}
%\input{generated/pgflibrarygraphdrawing-vector}


\subsubsection{The Interface and System Classes}

The class |Interface| is the main entry point in Lua. Every
communication from \TeX\ to Lua is done here. It provides methods to
create graphs, add nodes and edges to graphs, and finally to invoke the
selected algorithm. The |Interface| class manages the stack of
graphs. When the |newGraph()| function is called, it generates a new graph
object and pushes it on the graph stack. The methods |addNode()| and
|addEdge()| are called for each node and each edge, creating the
actual Lua objects and adding them to the current graph. 

After adding nodes and edges, when the scope ends, the interface
invokes the actual algorithm to layout the graph. This is done in the
|drawGraph()| function. The next step is to put the nodes back in the
\TeX\ output stream. This is invoked by the |finishGraph()| method. 

%\input{generated/pgflibrarygraphdrawing-interface}

Communication with \TeX\ on a basic layer is done in the |Sys|
class. The |beginShipout()| function opens a new scope in \pgfname\
to put all graph drawing nodes into. This prevents other graph objects
outside the graph drawing scope from referencing these nodes. The
|endShipout()| method closes the scope. Nodes and edges are put in the
output stream by the methods |putTeXBox()| and |putEdge()|, which
invoke callbacks to \TeX. 


\subsubsection{Support Classes and Functions}

Most classes in the framework (including the module objects) implement
the |__tostring| method, meaning that you can get a somewhat useful
string representation of the object via the standard |tostring|
function.
