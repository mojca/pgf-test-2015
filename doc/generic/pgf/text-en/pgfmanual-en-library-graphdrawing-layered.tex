\section{Graph Drawing Algorithms: Layered Layouts}


\begin{tikzlibrary}{graphdrawing.layered}
  This library provides keys for drawing graphs using the Sugiyama
  method, which is especially useful for drawing hierachical graphs.
  You should load the |graphdrawing| library first.
\end{tikzlibrary}

\begin{gdalgorithm}{layered layout}{modular layered}
  A modular version of the popular Sugiyama method...
\begin{codeexample}[]
\tikz [rounded corners] \graph [layered layout] { a -> {b,c -> {d,e,f} } -> h -> a };    
\end{codeexample}
\end{gdalgorithm}

\tikz [nodes={text height=.7em,text
    depth=.2em,draw=black!20,thick,fill=white,font=\footnotesize},
  >=spaced stealth', rounded
  corners] \graph [layered layout, level distance=1.25cm,sibling distance=1.25cm] {
